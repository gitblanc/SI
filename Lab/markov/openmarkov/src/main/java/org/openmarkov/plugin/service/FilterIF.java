 * This interface represents a contract for plugin filters.
 * A plugin filter is used to characterize a plugin by its internal structure
 * in terms of a set of constrains related to extended classes, implemented
 * interfaces and present annotations. Once defined the plugin can be used
 * to validate whether a class fulfills that constrains.
