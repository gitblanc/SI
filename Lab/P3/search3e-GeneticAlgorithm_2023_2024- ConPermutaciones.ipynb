    "Let's take a look at a more complicated problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the *Eight Queens* problem, we are tasked with placing eight queens on an 8x8 chessboard without any queen threatening the others (aka queens should not be in the same row, column or diagonal). In its general form the problem is defined as placing *N* queens in an NxN chessboard without any conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we need to think about the representation of each solution. We can go the naive route of representing the whole chessboard with the queens' placements on it. That is definitely one way to go about it, but for the purpose of this tutorial we will do something different. We have eight queens, so we will have a gene for each of them. The gene pool will be numbers from 0 to 7, for the different columns. The *position* of the gene in the state will denote the row the particular queen is placed in.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can have the state \"03304577\". Here the first gene with a value of 0 means \"the queen at row 0 is placed at column 0\", for the second gene \"the queen at row 1 is placed at column 3\" and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now need to think about the fitness function. On the graph coloring problem we counted the valid edges. The same thought process can be applied here. Instead of edges though, we have positioning between queens. If two queens are not threatening each other, we say they are at a \"non-attacking\" positioning. We can, therefore, count how many such positionings are there.\n",
